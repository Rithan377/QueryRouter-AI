# QueryRouter-AI
QueryRouter-AI is an intent-aware conversational system that dynamically routes user queries between casual chat and search-augmented reasoning using a modular node-based pipeline.  The system decides when to search, what to fetch, and when to rely purely on an LLM, producing grounded and efficient responses.
